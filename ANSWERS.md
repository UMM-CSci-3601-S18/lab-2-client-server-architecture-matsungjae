1. .gitignore is a list of files that we don't want Git to automatically 
    add because the files are automatically generated

2. Gradle automates a bunch of tasks that we would have to set up with the
command line otherwise.

3. Travis-CI automatically runs tests on the project every time we push changes
   to github.

4. A route is a url that causes the server to give a response.
